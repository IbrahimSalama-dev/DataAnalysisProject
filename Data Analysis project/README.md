# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding domestic flights in the US from the year 1987 till year 2008 each year has its own  csv file. 
The dataset I will be working with are the years from 2000 to 2008.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that Carrier are the largest reason for cancellation. 
Also from the year 2000 to the year 2008 the year 2001 has the most cancelled flights 
while the 2002 has the lowest, and the year 2007 has the most diverted flights but not with 
a large margin while the year 2008 has the lowest by a big margin. we also noticed that the 
airport DFW has the most diverted flights in year 2003. when I was studying the delays caused 
by weather in year 2003 I noticed that 99.3% of the flights were not affected by weather delays,
and in the first five months in the year there weren't any weather delays at all, and most weather 
delays are below the 50 minutes. when studying the distance and the arrival delay i came o find that
there is an inverse relation between the distance and the Arrival Delay so shorter trips tend to be 
more delayed than the longer ones. We also found that LAX airport is the airport with most departures 
on time and ORD and IAH are the most airports with early delays. when studying the average departure 
and arrival delay by origin and destination respectively from 2000 to 2008 we found that most delays 
are between 0 and 15 minutes.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on different type of delays and the influence of the flights Origin,
destination, distance, weather, and months of the year on the delays.

I used violin plots to draw the relation between airports and the delays, and scatter plots to draw 
relation between distance and delays, and the relation between arrival and departure delays.
